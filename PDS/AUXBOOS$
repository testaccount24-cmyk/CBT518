   This program will modify the in storage defaults used by
   ASM to determine when an AUX STORAGE SHORTAGE exists.
   It is based on IRA200E RESOLVE zap job by Thierry Falissard
   in CBT Tape file 432.  This memory zap allows you to change
   the 70% and 85 % thresholds to more aggressive values : 90%
   and 95 %.

   This program makes a direct update to memory after only
   minimal sanity checks.  The variable changed is an IBM internal
   NOT a programming interface. USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!
   Program is placed into the public domain and is property of the
   free world:-)

   Requires APF authorization lacking this abend 047
