//*      Thierry Falissard in CBT Tape file 432.  This memory       *   FILE 518

//*      Simple utility posted by Perry Winter in 1993 on           *   FILE 518
//*      IBM-MAIN which provides very nice generation of            *   FILE 518
//*      control cards on the fly from a PARM.  This program        *   FILE 518
//*      writes 80 character records based on user supplied         *   FILE 518
//*      parm.  All symbolics used in parm are expanded before      *   FILE 518
//*      execution of program.  The semicolon is used as a          *   FILE 518
//*      record separator in the parm therefore several 80          *   FILE 518
//*      character records can be generated from one 100 char       *   FILE 518
//*      parm field. The output records are written on ddname       *   FILE 518
//*      parm where the lrecl is always 80 characters.  The         *   FILE 518
//*      user can select any blocking factor on the parm dd         *   FILE 518
//*      card.  The output file can be concatenated before or       *   FILE 518
//*      after any 80 char LRECL data file in the job stream.       *   FILE 518

//*      Simple edit macro to SUBMIT a job then CANCEL out of       *   FILE 518

//*      REXX edit macro to submit the current job to a             *   FILE 518
